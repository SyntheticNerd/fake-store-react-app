## Overview

This is one of my first forays into working with react. I created a mobile friendly shop with the option to sort by categories, price, and alphabetically. I used context to simulate a cart and Styled Components for styling.

### The challenge

- Develop a multi-page single page application with a cart a checkout using the [fake store api](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

### What I learned

Working with React after having gained some experience with it is incredibly fun. The tools at your disposal allow you to quickly create interactive websites and multi-page websites with ease. It really leaves me feeling like a powerhouse in terms of front end development.

I learned a lot about context and will be looking forward to working with redux in my next project. Context is a incredibly powerful although it has its limitations, but to get all the power of context without the need to install a additional package is very convenient. For example if I wanted to host this on a cloud based service like firebase with firebase functions running a server I would want as few dependencies as possible so having context as an option for global state management is excellent.
